                Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (Icelandic: [ˈhafθour ˈjuːlijʏs ˈpjœr̥sɔːn] (About this soundlisten); often transliterated as Hafthor; born 26 November 1988) is an Icelandic professional strongman and actor. He is the first person to have won the Arnold Strongman Classic, Europe's Strongest Man and World's Strongest Man in the same calendar year.[1][2] He played Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane in the HBO series Game of Thrones for five seasons. He also is a former professional basketball player.

                Born in Reykjavík, Hafþór began his basketball career in 2004 with Division I team Breiðablik, moving to FSu in 2005. He transferred to Premier League side KR in 2006 before returning to FSu in 2007. He helped FSu to promotion from Division I to the Premier League but his career was cut short in 2008 due to a recurrent ankle injury. He subsequently began his strongman career.

                Basketball Career
            </h2>

            <p>
                Hafþór began his athletic career as a basketball player. At 2.06 m (6 ft 9 in),[3] he started his senior team career with Division I club Breiðablik in 2004, playing as a center. In 2005 he joined FSu Selfoss, also in the Icelandic Division I. After 10 games it was discovered that he had been playing with a broken bone in his ankle and would require surgery. After recovering from surgery, Hafþór moved to Úrvalsdeild powerhouse KR in 2006.[4] He missed most of the 2006–2007 season after a screw in his ankle shattered and had to be fixed by another surgery.[5]
            </p>

            <p>
                For the 2007–2008 season, he moved back to play for FSu Selfoss. He averaged 6.7 points per game,[6] helping the team achieve promotion to the Úrvalsdeild,[7] but the troublesome ankle forced him to retire from basketball after the season, at the age of 20.[8][9]
            </p>

            <p>
                Between 2004 and 2006 Hafþór played 32 games for the Icelandic junior national basketball teams.[10] In 2006 he played 8 games with Iceland's U-18 national team in Division A of the U18 European Championship.[11]

            <p>
                Hafþór met Icelandic strongman Magnús Ver Magnússon at his gym "Jakaból" in 2008, and Magnús said that Hafþór seemed a good prospect as a strongman.[14] Hafþór won several strongman contests in Iceland in 2010 including Strongest Man in Iceland,[15] Iceland's Strongest Viking, Westfjords Viking,[16] and five of six events at the OK Badur Strongman Championships.[17]
            </p>

            <p>
                Hafþór finished in second place at the inaugural Jón Páll Sigmarsson Classic in November 2010, behind Brian Shaw.[18] He won the 2011 Strongest Man in Iceland contest on 4 June 2011,[19] and the 2011 Iceland's Strongest Man contest on 18 June 2011.[20] He placed fourth in the Giants Live Poland 2011 event on 6 August 2011.[citation needed]

            <p>
                Hafþór took part in World's Strongest Man after earning a wild card invitation to the 2011 contest.[22] He came in sixth overall. Taking part again in ensuing years, he placed third in 2012, 2013 and 2015. He finished runner-up in 2014 event[23] to Žydrūnas Savickas and again in the 2016 event to Brian Shaw.[24] In 2017, Hafþór once again was runner up, this time to Eddie Hall.[25] Hafþór won the 2018 World's Strongest Man,[1][2] thus becoming the first Icelander to win the title since Magnús Ver Magnússon in 1996.[26]

                Hafþór defended his title at the Arnold Strongman Classic 2019; he finished on 45 points, 4.5 points ahead of runner-up Martins Licis.
